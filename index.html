Now she is 3 years old. sometimes she is afraid when she hears some unusual sounds but we try to make her feel comfortable. she LOVES playing with anything that makes noice and most of the times she is very active!!</p>

               <p>While watching the everyday life of blue these three years I realised how amazing hearing she has. She walks really carefully without doing any useless steps. She also knows where everything is placed around the house and if we move anything she gets REALLY confused!  </p>
